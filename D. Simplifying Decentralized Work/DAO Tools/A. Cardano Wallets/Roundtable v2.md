# Round Table V2
### Features

The new version of RoundTable supports both **Multisig** and **Personal** wallet. 

A multisig wallet is a type of digital wallet that requires more than one private key to authorize a transaction. "Multisig" stands for "multi-signature," which refers to the fact that multiple keys are needed to sign off on a transaction. These wallets are used to add an additional layer of security to cryptocurrency transactions.

In a standard personal wallet, there is only one private key that is used to authorize transactions. If this key is lost or stolen, the funds in the wallet can be compromised. With a multisig wallet, multiple private keys are required to authorize a transaction, so it is much more difficult for a hacker to gain access to the funds.

Multisig wallets are often used by organizations and communities to ensure that their cryptocurrency assets are secure. They can also be used by individuals as an extra security measure for their personal funds. 

In addition, new version of RoundTable supports stakeing.
