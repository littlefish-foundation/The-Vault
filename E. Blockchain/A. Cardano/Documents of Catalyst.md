## What is Project Catalyst?

[Project Catalyst](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/02/12/our-million-dollar-baby-project-catalyst/) is a series of **experiments** which seeks **to generate** the highest levels of **community innovation**. 

Catalyst brings on-chain governance to the Cardano blockchain by allowing the **community** to **self-determine** priorities for **growth**. 

It also lets participants deploy funding to proposals which tackle challenges and capitalize on opportunities that arise in the life cycle of Cardano.

Project Catalyst is divided into a **series of funds** which are deployed **every six weeks**. 
These funds will illicit ideas in the form of proposals from participants. **Each proposal** will **focus** around a **challenge** issued by the Project Catalyst team or the Project Catalyst community. The proposals will then go through a **community refinement process** where they are vetted for feasibility, auditability, and impact by a group of **incentivized proposal assessors**. Once the proposals have been finalized they will be voted on by the community and funds will be distributed in the form of ada to winning projects.
